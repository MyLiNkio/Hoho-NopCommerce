IMPORTANT!!!!! |
Before do that I kindly recommnd to perform this instruction in testin environment,
because tables structure cud change and script will not be able to deal with new structre.


1. Create MSSql database, check if credentials work (can connect to DB via Dbeaver for example).
2. Stop site, make DBBackup.
3. Copy AppSettings.json and plugin.json to a temp folder as reserve copy
4. Remove AppSettings.json and plugin.json from website
5. Run website and install without testing data on MS DB.
6. Copy plugin.json from temp folder to actual site and replace that one which was automatically created.
    Restart website and check if all expected plugins were installed.
7. Compare all tables in source DB and destination DB
8. Open project in D:\Hoho Code\AdditionalProjects\HohoDB_Data_Migration_MySqlToMsSql
9. Make sure that all credentials in connection strings are correct.
10. Publish project to web hosting (it will work very quickly there) or run locally.
11. Start migration.
